# Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Forecasting using Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network for Probabilistic Wind Power Prediction

This repository will provide the official implementation for our paper:

**"Spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting using group-feature graph convolutional network for probabilistic wind power prediction"**

## 📌 Overview

Accurate spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting of wind power is essential for the stable and efficient operation of modern power systems. However, large-scale wind integration presents challenges due to its hierarchical structure and strong spatio-temporal dependencies. This work proposes a novel **probabilistic forecasting framework** that tackles these challenges through a multi-level, end-to-end learning approach.

## 🔍 Key features of our framework include:

* **Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network:** Captures directional topological dependencies among wind farm clusters.
* **Crossformer with Frequency De-biasing:** Enhances frequency-domain modeling with a two-stage attention mechanism, mitigating spectral bias.
* **Hierarchical Reconciliation:** Maintains cross-level forecast consistency via a dedicated constraint layer.
* **Heavy-tailed Quantile Loss:** Supports robust multi-quantile regression for probabilistic forecasting.

## 🛠️ Code Release

The code will be **publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper**.

# Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Forecasting using Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network for Probabilistic Wind Power Prediction

This repository will provide the official implementation of our paper:

***Spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting using group-feature graph convolutional network for probabilistic wind power prediction***

## 📘 Overview

Accurate spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting of wind power plays a pivotal role in ensuring the stability and efficiency of modern power systems. However, the large-scale integration of wind energy poses significant challenges due to its intrinsic hierarchical organization and complex spatio-temporal dependencies.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel **probabilistic forecasting framework** tailored for multi-level wind power prediction. The framework leverages advanced deep learning modules and explicitly models the hierarchical and spectral characteristics of wind power systems to improve both accuracy and consistency.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network (GF-GCN):**
  Models directional topological relationships within wind farm clusters to capture spatial dependencies effectively.

* **Crossformer with Frequency De-biasing Mechanism:**
  A two-stage frequency-domain attention module is introduced to learn unified cross-band representations while mitigating spectral bias.

* **Coherent Reconciliation Constraint Layer:**
  Ensures structural consistency across hierarchical levels, addressing the mismatch issue in independent-level forecasting.

* **Heavy-tailed Quantile Loss Function:**
  Facilitates robust and accurate multi-quantile probabilistic forecasting, particularly effective under heavy-tailed distributions common in wind power data.

## 🛠 Code Availability

The code will be **officially released upon the acceptance of the paper**.

We appreciate your interest and invite you to stay tuned for future updates.
