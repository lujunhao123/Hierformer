# Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Forecasting using Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network for Probabilistic Wind Power Prediction

This repository will provide the official implementation for our paper:

**"Spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting using group-feature graph convolutional network for probabilistic wind power prediction"**

## üìå Overview

Accurate spatio-temporal hierarchical forecasting of wind power is essential for the stable and efficient operation of modern power systems. However, large-scale wind integration presents challenges due to its hierarchical structure and strong spatio-temporal dependencies. This work proposes a novel **probabilistic forecasting framework** that tackles these challenges through a multi-level, end-to-end learning approach.

## üîç Key features of our framework include:

* **Group-Feature Graph Convolutional Network:** Captures directional topological dependencies among wind farm clusters.
* **Crossformer with Frequency De-biasing:** Enhances frequency-domain modeling with a two-stage attention mechanism, mitigating spectral bias.
* **Hierarchical Reconciliation:** Maintains cross-level forecast consistency via a dedicated constraint layer.
* **Heavy-tailed Quantile Loss:** Supports robust multi-quantile regression for probabilistic forecasting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Release

The code will be **publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper**.

Please stay tuned for updates!
